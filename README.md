# Beyond the mean: assessing the role of temperature variability and predictability for shaping the size structure of reef fish communities
## Master's thesis, Department of Marine Sciences, Gothenburg University

This repository contains scripts, data links, and compiled data I use for my master's thesis. Dependencies are listed in the [requirements.txt](https://github.com/codymoly/msc_thesis/blob/main/requirements.txt).

## Summary
In this study, I investigated the effect of the variability and predictability of sea surface temperature (SST) on the size structure of reef fish communities in Australia using multiple linear regression analysis. Predicting the community-weighted mean (CWM) and variance (CWV) of body size (i.e., length), I compared the predictive performance of models containing different metrics of SST as predictors: mean, variance, seasonality, and the colour of noise (defined from the literature).

## Current state
Building hypotheses to test the effect of different metrics of sea surface temperature variability and predictability.
